## Summary

There are a couple of items that could be implemented to remove one drawback on this interactive site, which is its inability to filter independently by year, month, or day to determine certain patterns. This could be overcome by one of two methods: 

* Creating additional lists and programming for datetime information that allows for filtering on specific datetime data;
* Creating additional columns in the database to filter datetime information on.

Depending on what direction for development - whether the data owner will allow for additional contributors - should be a key factor to determine which path should be taken.
